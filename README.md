Seattle Collisions
Team no name - Michael Sui, Naved Krishnamurthy, Andrew Sang

This repo contains code analyzing Traffic Accidents In Seattle, created as part of
a project for the Technical Foundations of Informatics_ course at the UW iSchool.
For this project we mainly utilized ggplot2, shiny, ggmap, etc. to make our application. We
analyzed a variety of questions pertaining to peak hours for DUI accidents, where
accidents occur the most, and hit-and-run versus time of the day.
